The `flatbox` package
=====================

This package contains the definitions of two kinds of `tcolorbox`es:

* the `flatbox` which is a single left margin, a bold title and nothing else!
* the `ffbox` (for _f_illed _f_latbox) which is a... filled flatbox...

Please see the file [demo.pdf](https://github.com/leovalais/flatbox/blob/master/demo.pdf) for a full demonstration!
